-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=silent-magician-lv8-by-lucario515-on-deviantart>Silent Magician Lv8 By Lucario515 On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#silent-magician-lv8-by-lucario515-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://img03.deviantart.net/50a3/i/2009/311/b/d/silent_magician_lv8_by_lucario515.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qrUXDsHGd_jsVTHEF1oy1gHaKX&pid=15.1"' alt="silent magician lv8 by lucario515 on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: lucario515.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>magician silent lv8.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
